# Save the mice: in-silico perturbation of genes in deep generative models
This project explores the use of a deep generative model to infer gene expression trajectories in latent space. Specifically, the project seeks to construct cellular trajectories in latent space by gradually perturbing a cell and following the changes. The project will test this method on public single-cell datasets and compare results to other generative approaches, knock-down experiments, and RNAi-based gene silencing. Additionally, the project will experiment with combining clustering, manifold learning, and generative models.
